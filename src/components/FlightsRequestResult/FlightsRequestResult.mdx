# FlightsRequestResult
This component will parse the results of the flights request and render the results.

* When it's loading, the `Loader` component will be shown.
* If an empty array is passed, an `IconAndMessage` will inform the user that no flights were found.
* If `hasError` is set to true, an `IconAndMessage` will inform the user that an error occurred.
* If `flights` is set, the `FlightList` component will be rendered.
