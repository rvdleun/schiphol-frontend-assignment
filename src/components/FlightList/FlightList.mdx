# FlightList
This component will render the flight list. 

In case the expected and original time differ, the original time will be rendered with a strikethrough text.

[In the original mock-ups](https://github.com/rvdleun/schiphol-frontend-assignment/blob/main/development/Mocks.png), there was a plan to render the flight list with only limited data and let the user click on a row to get more information. Unfortunately, this was not implemented due to limited time. Instead, the airport and flight number cells are merged together to save space.
