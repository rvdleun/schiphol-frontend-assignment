# AirportSearchForm
This component is responsible for rendering the airport search form.

It consists of a single input. The user can type in the name of an airport and will emit an event when the user has filled in a valid search term. If the user did not, then an empty search term will be emitted.

A simple debounce is implemented to prevent the API from being called too often.
